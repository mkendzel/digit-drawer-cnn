An interactive Python tool that uses a Neural Network for real-time classification of freehand digit drawings (only works for 0-9)  
- Wraps a Convolutional Neural Network (trained on MNIST) into a single script
- Automatically saves/loads the trained model so you only need to train once
- Provides a simple Tkinter GUI: draw a digit, hit “Predict,” see the model’s guess and confidence level
